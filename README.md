> *The gods have fallen.*
> 
> *Xeroc, Noxus, even their predecessors… all of them have fallen under your reign. The Primordials, Nihilus, even the three Siblings – they were nothing more than mere obstacles on your unstoppable crusade.*
> 
> *Have you ever stopped to think about why you have been doing all this? Have you ever considered the consequences of what you have done to Terraria? I suppose I am alone in my own thoughts – because it seems that you have not done so at all.*
> 
> *You have transcended infinity - valor and deceit, truth and falsehood, loyalty and betrayal reduced to mere words under the weight of your absolute authority. If there truly was such a thing as a supreme “God”, then he would be dead by now – His blood on your hands that know naught but death and destruction.*
> 
> *At last, I have found out the true cause of all this. At last, I have traced the true anomaly underlying all that has happened. The overturning of Terraria’s order in the span of a few days or less… such a feat could have only been done by someone beyond this world.*
> 
> *To the one reading my thoughts from outside… seek the two Altars of Past and Present within your next journey – should you have conquered your ultimate challenge, the path to the Untrodden Sea shall make itself clear to you.*
> 
> *…I suppose I should apologize if all of this sounds a bit unclear, to say the least. Everything shall eventually reveal itself.*
> 
> *I will make sure of that.*
> 
> *-?????*

# INTRODUCTION
SHATTERED APOSTASY is an upcoming mod for Terraria that aims to serve as the ultimate love letter to the Terraria modding community, adding post-endgame content meant to be played after defeating both the Nameless Deity and enraged Mutant. The initial release will feature **Asteria, Transcendent Constellation** - a Present-side boss that embodies the current state of 1.4 tModLoader, embodying how far the community has come.

**From a simple, pixelated Lovecraftian eye to an eldritch God - we must remember the Past, savor the Present, and embrace the Future in order to advance Beyond.**
